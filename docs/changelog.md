## Unreleased / Bug fixes

- Launch APK: resolve real launchable activity (`cmd package resolve-activity`) with `monkey` fallback instead of hardcoded `.MainActivity`
- Process detection: `pidof` -> `pgrep` -> `ps` fallback chain for `isRunning`
- Monitor/recovery: correct success/failure handling around pcall + recovery boolean
- AutoExecute: treat global `config.autoExecute` as the shared script; per-instance path is an optional override
- Config template/working config: removed per-instance `autoExecutePath` in favour of the global AutoExecute path

---

## v0.2 — Android clone integration

- Auto-detect Roblox apps/clones during Setup Wizard via `cmd package resolve-activity` (works for renamed clones like `com.apengjers.v3`), plus optional `clonePackagePrefix` fast filter. Manual input still available.
- New `utils/roblox_link.lua`: safe game-link normalization
  - Public game links (`https://www.roblox.com/games/<placeId>`) optionally converted to `roblox://experiences/<placeId>`
  - Private server share links (`https://www.roblox.com/share?code=...&type=Server`) always opened as-is
  - Unknown/invalid links rejected safely
- Recovery now opens the instance game/private-server link through the normalizer before `am start VIEW`
- New settings: `clonePackagePrefix`, `normalizeGameLink`
- Main Menu: new shortcut `Launch + Join an instance` (choose an instance, launch its app and open its game link manually via `Recovery.launchAndJoin`)

---

## v0.3 — Launch-all + live per-instance status

- Main Menu `1) Launch + Join` now launches ALL configured instances (no manual pick), then immediately starts the monitor.
- New `managers/status.lua`: tracks per-instance status — `offline`, `starting`, `ingame`, `stuck`, `freeze`, `recovery`.
- Freeze detection via logcat ANR (`ANR in <package>`) with a grace-period fallback for `stuck`.
- `Recovery.relaunch()` force-stops and relaunches an app that has stayed frozen for `freezeTimeout` (default 300s, counted from when stuck/freeze was set).
- Monitor prints a live per-instance status table each cycle.
- New settings: `freezeTimeout`, `gracePeriod`, `anrCheckEnabled`.

---

## v0.3.1 — Fix launch & public link

- Launch now uses `monkey -p <pkg> -c LAUNCHER 1` FIRST (works in Termux without `cmd package resolve-activity`, which is unavailable in a non-root Termux shell); resolve-activity is only a fallback and no longer blocks the launch. Fixes instances not opening.
- Public game links are now ALWAYS converted to the deep link `roblox://experiences/<placeId>` so Roblox joins the place directly (an https URL only wakes the app without entering the game).
- Removed the `normalizeGameLink` setting/config/menu option (public links always deep-link; private `/share` links are still opened as-is).
- `utils/android.lua` launch updated to match the monkey-first strategy.

---

## v0.3.2 — Fix multiple-clone launch (App Cloner floating)

- Launch now targets the package EXPLICITLY first: `am start -a MAIN -c LAUNCHER -p <pkg>`. This starts each clone's own launcher task (works for App Cloner clones like `com.apengjers.v3`/`v4`, whose activities stay `com.roblox.client.*`) without depending on `cmd package resolve-activity`. `monkey` and resolve-activity remain fallbacks.
- "Launch All" (`main.lua` option 1) now pauses ~3s between instances so a floating-window clone appears before the next one is launched.
- `Android.openURL` now accepts an optional target package and opens the game link with `-p <pkg>` so a `roblox://experiences/<placeId>` deep link is delivered to the correct clone instead of a single shared default handler. Falls back to a non-targeted VIEW if the targeted start fails.

---

## v0.3.3 — Fix disappearing config & stuck "ingame" status

- `core/config.lua serializeTable`: array/numeric keys now serialize as real integer keys (`[1] = ...`) instead of string keys (`["1"] = ...`). Previously a save rewrote `instances` with string keys which `ipairs` could not read, so a later save blanked the config to `instances = {}`.
- `managers/instance.lua load` + `core/setup_wizard.lua nextId`: read with `pairs()` and normalize mixed string/number keys so configured instances always survive a reload.
- `managers/apk.lua isRunning`: process matching is now anchored to the START of the process command (`^<pkg>($|:)`) instead of a loose substring. This fixes status getting stuck at "ingame" after an app is closed (a leftover process containing the name as a substring no longer counts), so the monitor now reports `offline` and recovers/relaunches the app.

---

## v0.3.4 — Launch one clone at a time

- `Recovery.waitUntilRunning()` added: after launching a clone, poll `APK.isRunning()` until its process is observed (then a short settle pause) or a timeout elapses.
- "Launch All" (menu 1) now launches clones ONE AT A TIME — it waits for each clone to reopen before starting the next, so multiple floating-window clones each get a chance to appear instead of one being crowded out (previously a fixed 3s pause / then a monitor that still reported "starting").
- New settings (Settings menu → `14) Edit launch wait settings`): `launchWaitInterval` (3s), `launchWaitTimeout` (90s), `launchSettleDelay` (5s).

---

## v0.3.5 — Fix launch hang (isRunning never matched)

- Fixed `managers/apk.lua escapeRegex`: the replacement was producing `%.` (percent-dot) instead of `\.` (backslash-dot), so the `pgrep -f '^com\.apengjers\.v6($|:)'` pattern never matched and `isRunning` always returned false. `waitUntilRunning` then waited a full timeout per clone, making "Launch All" appear stuck (repeating `pidof`/`pgrep`/`ps`).
- `escapeRegex` now emits backslash escapes (`\.`) valid for POSIX ERE (`pgrep -f`).
- `ps -A` fallback compares the process command start with a plain (non-regex) check (`cmd == pkg or cmd starts with pkg..":"`) instead of feeding an ERE pattern to Lua's `string.match`.

---

## v0.3.6 — Count-based launch wait + public link joins the map

- New `managers/apk.lua APKManager.countProcess(name)`: counts running processes for a base name (e.g. `com.roblox.client`) via pgrep/pidof/ps. App Cloner clones all run as `com.roblox.client`, so the count tracks how many clones are actually up regardless of the renamed package.
- `Recovery.waitUntilRunning` now accepts a `target` count: it waits until `countProcess(processCheckName) >= target` (then a settle pause) or a (shortened) timeout. Default `launchWaitTimeout` lowered 90→30s so a failed detection never hangs "Launch All".
- "Launch All" (`main.lua`) records a baseline `countProcess` before the loop, then after launching clone `i` waits for `count >= baseline + i` before starting the next — launching one clone at a time, each confirmed open before the next.
- New setting `processCheckName` (default `com.roblox.client`) — the base process counted; editable via Settings → `14) Edit launch wait settings`.
- `utils/roblox_link.lua`: public game links now convert to `roblox://placeId=<placeId>` (deep link that drops straight into the game/map) instead of `roblox://experiences/<placeId>` (which only opened the game's page on mobile).

---

## v0.3.7 — Root (su) process detection + direct-join deep link

- **Root required** (`utils/shell.lua`): every shell command now runs through `su -c '...'` when `useRoot` is enabled (default `true`). This is the real fix for "detection looks broken": on a rooted device Android 11+, Termux running as a NORMAL user cannot see other apps' processes, so every `pidof`/`pgrep`/`ps` probe returned empty and every instance looked offline. Running as root (Magisk) makes the Monitor see the real per-clone processes again. Set `useRoot = false` on a non-root device.
- **Correct process model**: App Cloner clones keep their OWN package process name (`com.apengjers.v3`, etc. — verified from the clone APK manifest and on-device `su -c "pidof com.apengjers.v3"`), NOT `com.roblox.client` as v0.3.6 assumed. `com.roblox.client` is only the class/activity base, not the process name.
- `managers/apk.lua`: new `APK.countRunning(packages)` counts how many of the given configured packages report `isRunning` — accurate per-clone count without needing a shared base name.
- `Recovery.waitUntilRunning` + "Launch All": replaced the `countProcess(processCheckName)` target with `targetCount` of running instances (`countRunning >= baseline + i`). Drops the now-unneeded `processCheckName` setting.
- `utils/roblox_link.lua`: public game links now convert to **`robloxmobile://placeID=<placeId>`** (capital `ID`) — the scheme the clones register and that `ActivityProtocolLaunch` handles by joining the map directly — instead of `roblox://placeId=<placeId>` which only opened the game's page. `robloxmobile://` added to the accepted-scheme whitelist.
- New setting `useRoot` (default `true`), editable via Settings → `14) Edit launch wait settings`.

---

## v0.3.8 — Quiet monitor + direct-join deep link

- `core/logger.lua`: new console `logLevel` filter (default `INFO`). `Logger.debug` lines are now hidden unless `logLevel = "DEBUG"`, fixing the monitor being flooded with `su -c ...` and per-probe `pidof`/`pgrep`/`ps` debug spam every cycle. Set to DEBUG via Settings → `15) Edit logLevel` for troubleshooting.
- `managers/status.lua printSummary`: status table rewritten as one compact line — e.g. `1=starting  2=running  3=freeze  4=recovery` — instead of the verbose multi-line log-style output.
- New setting `logLevel` (default `INFO`), editable via Settings → `15) Edit logLevel`.
- `utils/roblox_link.lua`: public game links now convert to **`roblox://experiences/start?placeId=<placeId>`** — the deep link form Roblox uses to START/join the game directly. Earlier formats (`roblox://experiences/<id>`, `roblox://placeId=...`, `robloxmobile://placeID=`) only opened the game's page on this client. Example: `https://www.roblox.com/games/110776611234/Steal-An-Egg` → `roblox://experiences/start?placeId=110776611234`.

---

## v0.3.9 — Force ActivityProtocolLaunch for direct join

- `utils/android.lua openURL`: public-game links are now delivered by forcing the clone's **`ActivityProtocolLaunch`** handler via `am start -a VIEW -d '<url>' -n <pkg>/com.roblox.client.ActivityProtocolLaunch`, instead of the old `-p <pkg>` (which lets Android pick an activity that only shows the game's page). Falls back to `-p <pkg>` then an untargeted VIEW, logging which strategy ran.
- `utils/roblox_link.lua`: public links convert back to **`robloxmobile://placeID=<placeId>`** — the form that `ActivityProtocolLaunch` on the App Cloner clones joins straight into the map (verified on the cloned Roblox activity set and the Android direct-join path).

## v0.4.0 — roblox://placeId= auto-join via -p (proven per-clone)

- `utils/roblox_link.lua`: public game links convert to **`roblox://placeId=<placeId>`** (was `robloxmobile://placeID=` / earlier `roblox://experiences/start?placeId=`).
- `utils/android.lua openURL`: primary strategy is now **`am start -a VIEW -d '<url>' -p <clone>`**; the `-n <pkg>/com.roblox.client.ActivityProtocolLaunch` strategy (which only opened the game page) is removed. Untargeted VIEW remains as fallback.
- On-device testing proved `roblox://placeId=<id>` delivers the clone's deep-link join directly into the map, and `-p com.apengjers.v3/v4` routes each to its own account.

## v0.4.1 — wait for clone before joining

- `managers/recovery.lua launchAndJoin`: now polls until the clone's process is running (up to `checkTimeout`, with a short `launchSettleDelay` settle) **before** sending the deep link. Previously the join link was sent immediately after launch, landing while the app was still on the splash screen, so Roblox showed the game's page instead of auto-joining. Mirrors the wait already done by the monitor's `recover` path.

## v0.4.2 — direct deep-link join + Ctrl+C hard stop

- `managers/recovery.lua launchAndJoin`: instances with a `privateServer` are now joined by sending the deep link **directly** (`openGameLink`), **without** a separate `APK.launch` (MAIN/LAUNCHER) first. On-device proof: firing `roblox://placeId=<id>` + `-p <clone>` at a cold clone auto-joins the map, whereas launching through the launcher activity first left the app on its home screen so the link only showed the game page. `APK.launch` is still used for instances with no link.
- `main.lua`: Ctrl+C hard stop — `prompt()` now `os.exit(0)` when `io.read()` returns nil (Ctrl+C/EOF in the menu), plus "tekan Ctrl+C untuk berhenti" hints in the menu and before the monitor starts.

## v0.4.3 — cold start (force-stop) before join

- `managers/recovery.lua launchAndJoin`: instances with a `privateServer` are now **force-stopped first** (`APK.forceStop(pkg)`, 1s settle) before the join deep link `roblox://placeId=<id>` + `-p <clone>` is sent. On-device proof: option-A join only auto-enters the map from a *cold* clone; if the clone is still warm the link just shows the game page. This makes the tool mirror the manual procedure that worked (force-stop → join link).
- Instances without a link still use `APK.launch(pkg)`.

## v0.4.4 — self-contained join link in recovery.lua

- `managers/recovery.lua`: `openGameLink` is now **self-contained** — it extracts the place id and builds `roblox://placeId=<id>` directly (no longer depends on `utils/roblox_link` syncing to the device). Handles `https://www.roblox.com/games/<id>/...`, `?placeId=<id>`, `roblox://placeId=<id>`, `roblox://experiences/<id>`. Private-server `/share` links stay untouched. Removed the unused `RobloxLink` require. This guarantees the tool sends the proven auto-join form regardless of other files.
- Prior fix (v0.4.3) already force-stops the clone (cold start) before sending the link.

## v0.4.5 — colored live-status dashboard + Ctrl+C actually stops monitoring

- `managers/status.lua`: `printSummary` now clears the terminal (`\27[2J\27[H`) each cycle and renders a full multi-row, colorized table instead of stacking plain lines:
  - left column = package clone (`com.apengjers.v3`), right column = status label + color (Running=green, Stuck=red, Recovery=yellow, Starting=cyan, Offline=dim).
  - footer rows show real **Memory Usage** (`/proc/meminfo`: % + free MB) and **Storage Available** (`df -h`), best-effort with a 30s cache to avoid shell cost every cycle.
- `managers/monitor.lua`: installs a **SIGINT handler via lua-posix** so Ctrl+C truly stops monitoring on Termux. Root cause fixed: `os.execute("sleep")` swallows SIGINT (POSIX `system()` blocks it), so without a handler Ctrl+C did nothing; the handler flips `running = false`.
- `utils/timer.lua`: new `Timer.sleepInterruptible(seconds, isStopped)` sleeps in 0.25s steps, so once the SIGINT handler fires the monitor exits within ~0.25s instead of waiting out the whole interval. Monitor loop now uses it.
- `main.lua`: after the monitor stops, if `Monitor.interrupted()` is true (Ctrl+C pressed) the program exits cleanly (`os.exit(0)`) instead of returning to the menu.
- **Requires** `pkg install lua-posix` on Termux for Ctrl+C to work.
- Cleanup: removed now-unused `utils/roblox_link.lua`, `debug_normalize.lua`, and `debugging.txt`; updated `README.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` references.

## v0.4.6 — fix misaligned monitor table

- `managers/status.lua`: fixed the status-table layout that rendered with borders "straying" into the middle of rows on Termux:
  - **Border width now equals body width** (they were out by 4 chars, so the `+`/`|` separators never lined up). The border is generated from the same width as a data row.
  - The frame is built as **one single string** and cleared+written in a single `io.write("\27[2J\27[H" .. frame)` + flush, instead of clearing in a separate `io.write` — the earlier cursor-home (`\27[H`) wrote into the middle of later printed rows.
  - `\27[0m` reset is only emitted on colored status cells (no stray escapes on the header/footer rows).
  - Column widths tuned (Instance 24 / Status 18) so values like `com.apengjers.v3`, `38% (2466MB Free)`, and `75G Free` fit without overflow.

## v0.4.7 — flicker-free in-place dashboard + clean console

- `managers/status.lua`: `printSummary` now redraws **in place** instead of full-screen clearing every cycle:
  - Tracks the drawn frame height and moves the cursor back up (`\27[<n>A`) each refresh, then redraws and clears any leftover below (`\27[J`) — no more screen flicker.
  - Rows are joined with **`\r\n` (CRLF)** instead of `\n` — fixes rows drifting rightward on Termux (LF alone doesn't reset the column to 0 when ONLCR is off), which was the root cause of the "stray border" mess visible both on screen and in copy/paste.
  - Hides/shows the cursor around each draw (`\27[?25l`/`\27[?25h`) for a smooth refresh.
  - New `Status.resetDashboard()` resets the frame position at the start of each monitor session.
- `core/logger.lua`: added `Logger.setConsoleVisible(bool)`. When `false`, log lines are written to the file only (not the console), so monitor event logs don't push the dashboard around.
- `managers/monitor.lua`: hides console logging while monitoring (`Logger.setConsoleVisible(false)` + `Status.resetDashboard()`), and restores it plus the cursor (`\27[?25h\r\n`) when the monitor stops.
- Net effect: monitoring shows only a clean, non-flickering status dashboard; full logs still go to `data/rejoin.log`; Ctrl+C stops and returns to a normal console.
